This is a project for students at Hack Reactor. Back when I attended Hack Reactor, learning React was not part of the curriculum. I decided to see if HR had any new projects since I had a lot of fun completing them (they are basically TDD style sprints that walk you through learning a new technology by making tests pass). I found this one on a random students github and decided to complete it myself!
